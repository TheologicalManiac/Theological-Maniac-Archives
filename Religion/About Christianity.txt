The Christianity portion dives far past surface devotion, 
into something closer to deconstruction tearing apart the scaffolding of belief to see what holds and what crumbles. 
It’s a weaving of my own confessions with the rigor of theological scholarship, 
unafraid to question canon, tradition, and even the nature of God as presented to us. 
Here, scripture is not recited but dissected, its cultural layers peeled back, 
its human fingerprints examined. You’ll find reflections that walk the knife’s edge between reverence and doubt, 
exploring how faith survives or mutates when its foundations are shaken, 
and how the soul redefines itself when the familiar architecture of belief begins to fall away.
