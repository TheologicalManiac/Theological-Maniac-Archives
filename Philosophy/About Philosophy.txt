The philosophy portion is where my own relentless questioning collides with centuries of thought, 
pulling from both personal revelations and the works of those who spent lifetimes wrestling with meaning. 
It doesn’t simply admire ideas from a distance—it takes them apart, tests their weight, 
and sometimes lets them shatter. Here, I explore existence, morality, 
and the fragile illusions we build to keep ourselves sane, drawing as much from sleepless nights as from rigorous study. 
It’s a space where reason and absurdity share the same table, 
where the search for truth is less about finding an answer and more about learning how to live inside the questions.
